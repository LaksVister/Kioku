> What new?

	Bug fix:

> Why do I need a text content file "Content"?
This is a dictionary in which all the contents are written, without it the program will not open.

> Can I change the text?
Yes! To do this, use special characters as described in the example below.
#^~$# > after these characters is the name of the dictionary, but the name can only be written together.
#@*?# > after these characters there is a dictionary code to open it, but the code can only be written 
together. It is also used to open at the beginning and close at the end of the dictionary.
#&:%# > after these characters is the name of the theme. After reappearance these characters is the name 
of the storage. And so on in a circle until this symbol appears without a theme.
> Caution! You can wrap to the next line, but do not separate the special characters " #^~$# ", " #@*?# " and " #&:%# ".
Example:
#@*?# #^~$# NAME_1 #@*?# CODE_1 #&:%# THEME 1 #&:%# STORAGE 1 #&:%# THEME 2 #&:%# STORAGE 2
#&:%# THEME INFINITY #&:%# STORAGE INFINITY #&:%# #@*?# #^~$# NAME_2 #@*?# CODE_2 #&:%# TH
EME INFINITY #&:%# STORAGE INFINITY #&:%# #@*?#
 #^~$# NAME_INFINITY #@*?# CODE_INFINITY #&:%# THEME INF... #&:%# STORAGE INF... #&:%# #@*?#

> How use program?
When you open the console. That will list all the themes in the current dictionary. The current 
default dictionary is the one who stands first in "Sorages.txt". After that, other dictionaries 
and an access code to them are listed. When this is done, you can enter a theme or the contents 
of this theme. Be sure to enter the whole word of the theme you need, uut for searching in 
storage it's not obligatory. After entering the key word, the program will display all the storages 
in which the word is, but if you entered the key theme, it will appear last in the list, then 
the program will offer you to exit or continue the search.
Bonus:
You don't need to enter "n" to continue the program. Just press Enter to continue.
